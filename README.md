## My process

- It took me a bit long time to finish this project. Just because I was not able to find the exact same social media icons for it. Also fixing the background image took some time. During that time I finished other projects and learned from them. And then it was very easy to complete this. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - tailwind css


### What I learned
I learned about ring, ring offset and modifying svg files.
